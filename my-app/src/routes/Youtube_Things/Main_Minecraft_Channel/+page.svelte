    </span>
    <p style="font-size: 3em; color: white  "> Well, this was my first and main channel. Before it I had another youtube channel, but I unfortuantley lost the Gmail to it randomly one day because google felt like they wanted to lock me out for "Security purposes"
      But thats besides the point, originally this was my channel for some random content I posted, be it roams.io/bettermope.io/mohio or whatever you call it now, roblox, memes, ecetera. But I decided to do minecraft for a change.
      But my first videos did horribly, then the next, then the next, but I kept on perservering and I finally started getting into the hundreds of views! I started posting shorts and unlisted all the irrevalent content on my youtube
      channel. And today I am doing very good working on new videos and stuff! As always this is a minecraft first youtube channel So thats where I am right now, ill report back when I get 1000 subscribers :)
